## Introduction

An `HTTP` web server is a software application that `receives requests `and `sends responses` using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is responsible for serving web content such as HTML pages, images, videos, and other resources to clients, typically web browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

HTTP web servers typically listen on port `80` or `443` for incoming requests, and use the HTTP protocol to communicate with clients. They can serve `static` content directly from the `file system` or generate `dynamic content` by running scripts or applications.

Some popular HTTP web servers include `Apache`, `Nginx`, `Microsoft IIS`, and `Caddy`. These servers can be configured with various features such as `SSL/TLS encryption`, `load balancing`, `caching`, and more to optimize performance and security for web applications.

## Apache Web Server

1. First, we need the domain make sure to buy the domain name either from [Godaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com/en-in) or [Google Domain Name](https://domains.google.com/registrar/search).

2. Create an `A` record in the `DNS` settings that points to the IP address of your server where `Apache` is installed.(I chosed `Godaddy.com`).

3. Get the Public Ip from EC2 Instance by typing

   ```bash
   curl ifconfig.me
   ```

4. Install `Apache` web server on your server by running the following command

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
   ```

5. Create a new virtual host configuration file for your domain. You can do this by creating a new file in the `/etc/apache2/sites-available/` directory with a name like `www.decodeai.in.conf`

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/www.decodeai.in.conf
   ```

6. Inside the file, add the following configuration:

   ```bash
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName www.decodeai.in
       ServerAlias decodeai.in
       DocumentRoot /var/www/www.decodeai.in/public_html
       ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/www.decodeai.in_error.log
       CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/www.decodeai.in_access.log combined
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

7. Create the directory for your domain's files:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /var/www/www.decodeai.in/public_html
   ```

8. Set the appropriate permissions for the directory:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/www.decodeai.in/public_html
   sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/www.decodeai.in
   ```

9. Create an index file in the `public_html` directory to test the configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /var/www/www.decodeai.in/public_html/index.html
   ```

   Add some content to the file, such as "`Hello World`".

10. Enable the virtual host and restart Apache:

    ```bash
    sudo a2ensite www.decodeai.in.conf
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

11. Finally, verify that your website is accessible through your domain name by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://www.decodeai.in`. You should see the content you added to the index file in the previous step.

That's it! Your Apache web server is now configured to serve your website using your domain name `www.decodeai.in`.

## Summary

An `HTTP` web server `receives` and `sends` responses using the `HTTP` protocol, serving `web content `to clients such as `web browsers`. It can serve static content directly or generate dynamic content by running scripts or applications. Popular HTTP web servers include `Apache`, `Nginx`, `Microsoft IIS`, and `Caddy`, with various features for `performance` and `security optimization` of web applications.
